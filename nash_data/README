This folder contains scripts and population data from an experiment on
Nash@QuDIT using the notebook Quandary_pulse.ipynb. This notebook
reads control pulses (p_ctrl.dat & q_ctrl.dat) for a single-qudit,
swap 0-2 gate, that are generated by Quandary. These files are ASCII
formatted text files and should have a sampling rate of 64 samples per
nano-second.

The notebook performs experiments on the hardware and saves population
data, starting from three initial states (|0>, |1> & |2>) on a regular
grid in time with time step 4 ns (first data point is at 4 ns). The
population data is corrected using the confusion matrix method and
saved on files "init_X_pop_cor.dat", where X={0,1,2} refers to the
initial state. Each line in each file is a comma-separated list of 3
numbers, corresponding to the averaged population of (|0>, |1>, |2>)
for one time-level.
