## Another example: Run quandary on varying parameters 
#mynsplines = [10,20,30]

#
#  # Change the quandary configurations.
#  quandary.nsplines = nsplines

#  # Alternatively, you could also just set up a new Quandary instance with the new configuration. In this case it would be 
#  # quandary = Quandary(nsplines=nsplines, freq01=freq01, Jkl=Jkl, rotfreq=rotfreq, T=T, targetgate=unitary, verbose=verbose, rand_seed=rand_seed) 
#
#  # Execute quandary locally in a specified data directory
#  dir="nsplines_"+str(nsplines)
#  t, pt, qt, infidelity, expectedEnergy, population = quandary.optimize(datadir=dir)
